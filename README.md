## Blockchain for Family Tree and Ancestry Tracking System

#### Preserving and Verifying Family Histories
#### Problem:
Maintaining accurate family trees and ancestral records is challenging due to:

1.	Loss of Records: Historical documents, such as birth certificates, marriage licenses, DNA tests, and baptism certificates, can be lost or destroyed.
2.	Lack of Verification: Current digital platforms rely heavily on user-provided data, which may be incomplete, inaccurate, or unverifiable.
3.	Unapproved Changes: Unauthorized or inaccurate updates to family trees can create conflicts and reduce trust in shared family records.
4.	Fragmentation of Family Heritage: Multimedia, such as photos and videos, often become scattered across different platforms and devices, leading to loss of historical data.
5.	Inheritance Disputes: Tracking wealth, inheritance, and assets across generations can be complicated

#### We will ensure: 

1. Immutability: Family records stored on the blockchain are tamper-proof and preserved indefinitely.
2.	Transparency: Blockchain enables clear tracking of relationships and ancestry links.
3.	Decentralization: Data is not controlled by a single entity, ensuring equal access for all family members.
4.	Privacy and Security: Cryptographic techniques protect sensitive family data while allowing only authorized individuals to access it.
5.	Governance and Trust: A voting mechanism ensures all family members can approve or reject changes, maintaining trust in the system

#### How it will be working:
1. Creating Family Nodes
Each family member is represented as a unique node on the blockchain forming links for relationships (e.g., parent, sibling, spouse).

2. Adding Verified Records
 - Traditional Problem: Historical records are often unverifiable or incomplete.
 - Blockchain Application: Verified documents (e.g., birth certificates, marriage licenses, DNA tests) are uploaded and linked to nodes.
 - Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity .
3. Expanding the Tree: Authorized family members can add new nodes and Smart contracts verify new entries for accuracy and prevent duplicate or conflicting data.
4. Data Retrieval and Sharing
 - Users can view the tree through a decentralized app (dApp).
 - Access permissions are managed via smart contracts, ensuring privacy.
 - Time-stamped records allow users to trace when and how updates were made.

#### Additional features 

1.	Voting feature to  allow the family to approve or reject updates [adding new family member or modifying existing relationships].
2.	Digital Heritage Vault: Families can store multimedia (e.g., photos, videos, voice recordings) in an immutable "heritage vault" for future generations.
3.	Wealth tracking: inheritance and assets passed down through generations, ensuring transparency.
